		<p style="font-size: 12px;">Minutes are calculated by multiplying:<br/> games played X minutes in a game (regulation or OT) X number of players a team can play at once (5). A player's total minutes are divided by the team's total minutes to get the percentage of how much time that player has been on the court. A single player can take up to 20% of their team's minutes.</p>
